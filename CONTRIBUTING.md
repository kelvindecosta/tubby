# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tubby!

For someone unfamiliar with the code base,
the most efficient way to contribute is
to submit a [feature request](#feature-requests) or [bug report](#bug-reports).

If you want to dive into the source code,
you can submit a [patch](#patches) as well,
either working on your own ideas or [existing issues][issues].

## Feature Requests

Do you have an idea for an awesome new feature for Tubby?
Please [submit a feature request][issue].
It's great to hear about new ideas!

If you are inclined to do so,
you're welcome to [fork][fork] Tubby,
work on implementing the feature yourself,
and submit a patch.
In this case, it's _highly recommended_ that you first [open an issue][issue]
describing your enhancement to get early feedback
on the new feature that you are implementing.
This will help avoid wasted efforts and ensure that your work is incorporated
into the code base.

## Bug Reports

Sorry about that!
Bug reports are greatly appreciated!

When you [submit a bug report][issue],
please include relevant information
such as Tubby version, operating system,
error messages, and steps to reproduce the bug.
The more details you can include,
the easier it is to find and fix the bug.

## Patches

Want to hack on Tubby? Awesome!

If there are [open issues][issues],
you're more than welcome to work on those -
this is probably the best way to contribute to Tubby.
If you have your own ideas, that's great too!
In that case, before working on substantial changes to the code base,
it is _highly recommended_ that you first [open an issue][issue]
describing what you intend to work on.

**Patches are generally submitted as pull requests.**

Any changes to the code base should
follow the style and coding conventions used in the rest of the project.
